# README Maintenance

Always keep the final line up to date with the current month and year in English locale.

Required format
```
Last updated: Month YYYY
```

Examples
- `Last updated: August 2025`

Notes
- The pre-commit hook validates this line when `README.md` is modified.
- Month names must be English (en_US); the tooling uses `LC_TIME=C`.
