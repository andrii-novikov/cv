# Pre-commit Hooks

This repo uses the pre-commit framework to run checks locally before each commit.

Setup (per machine)
```bash
pip3 install pre-commit
pre-commit install
# If not on PATH:
python3 -m pre_commit install
```

Manual runs
```bash
pre-commit run                    # staged files
pre-commit run --all-files        # all files
pre-commit run readme-date-check  # single hook
```

Included hooks
- README Date Check: Ensures `README.md` contains `Last updated: Month YYYY` matching the current date (English month names via `LC_TIME=C`).

Key files
- Config: [.pre-commit-config.yaml](mdc:.pre-commit-config.yaml)
- Script: [scripts/check_readme_date.sh](mdc:scripts/check_readme_date.sh)

Notes
- If `README.md` is staged and the date is outdated/missing, the commit will fail with guidance.
- To bypass in emergencies: `git commit --no-verify -m "..."` (not recommended).
